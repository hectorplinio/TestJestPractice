# TestJestPractice
_In this repository, I am going to do some examples of test. I use unitTest, integrationTest and e2e test too._

## Starting 🚀
 
 ## From Unit test to E2E 🏁
_In Folder "./calculator", have some Javascript documents with some functions. The first unit test is calculatorArea.js where i have some funtions for calculate the area of 
Square, Rectangle or Triangle. That test file stay in "./__test__/uniTests/calculatorArea.test.js". Into this document i do some test for some results of posible parameters._

_In same Folder, have another Javascript documents that that do different functions and thats documents have their tests in "./__test__"._

_Next step is use a intregration tests to do the check that shape and use the unitTest for calculate that area_.

_"insertAreaBBDD.js" is a function that checks the state of the DB and after insert the shape and area into DB_.

-The last test is and e2e test, first check form of Shape, calculate area of this form and finally add result in DB_.

## Another test
_Another test that i do is in folder "./getTime" in "getTime.js" have two functions, firt get local hour and return this value and second funtion return you the moment of day where we are_.

_From this test i have unit test and integration test, the test files stay in folder "./__test__", in it I have different tests_.
